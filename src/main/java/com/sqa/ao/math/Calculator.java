Create a class which reads the properties and provides feedback based on supplied values.

Class should have helper methods with following signatures:
public double static addNumbers(double operand1, double operand2);
public double static multiplyNumbers(double operand1, double operand2);
public double static divideNumbers(double operand1, double operand2);

JUnit test case with a double[][] data which should gather data from properties file.
Your JUnit Class must satisfy the following requirements:
- Have only three variables double[][] data, double[] test, and int currentTestIndex
- A Junit Class variable which holds all values from properties file into a double[][] 2D array - May want to refer to the split() command
- The 2D matrix should be populated in the beginning of the JUnit life cycle
- The 2D matrix should be set to null at the end of the JUnit life cycle
- A double[] should be captured from the 2D array before each method - This array represents an individual test.
- A double[] should be set to null after each method call, as well as currentTestIndex incremented.
- A test method for each set of numbers (total of 8 Test methods), which each test the 3 functions above and compare to exp***Result values

Properties File: calculate.properties
operand1 = 8,5,7,5,8,9,3,5
operand2 = 2,1,6,3,8,3,2,1
expAddResult = 10,6,13,9,16,12,6,6
expSubResult = 6,4,1,2,0,7,1,4
expMultResult = 16,6,42,15,84,27,5,5
[4:28:04 PM] JF Nepton: Sorry should be addNumbers, subtractNumbers, and multplyNumbers, NOT divideNumbers

[6:04:17 PM] JF Nepton: Guide to naming conventions on groupId, artifactId and version
groupId will identify your project uniquely across all projects, so we need to enforce a naming schema. It has to follow the package name rules, what means that has to be at least as a domain name you control, and you can create as many subgroups as you want. Look at More information about package names.
eg. org.apache.maven, org.apache.commons

A good way to determine the granularity of the groupId is to use the project structure. That is, if the current project is a multiple module project, it should append a new identifier to the parent's groupId.

eg. org.apache.maven, org.apache.maven.plugins, org.apache.maven.reporting

artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed.
eg. maven, commons-math

version if you distribute it then you can choose any typical version with numbers and dots (1.0, 1.1, 1.0.1, ...). Don't use dates as they are usually associated with SNAPSHOT (nightly) builds. If it's a third party artifact, you have to use their version number whatever it is, and as strange as it can look.
eg. 2.0, 2.0.1, 1.3.1
